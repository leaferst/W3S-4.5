ORMs - Object Relation Mapping
    Implementation of writing queries using object-oriented programming.

Create a models file with conn.js to act as the connection to the database.

new Sequelize model:
    new Sequelize(databaseName, username, password, {
        host: link to connect to
        dialect: SQL language.
    })

A model is an abstraction that represents a table in a database.

There are two ways to define a model:
    Call sequelize.define(modelName, attributes, options)
    Extend Model and call init(attributes, options)
